# Runclock

A run/activity tracker using good old HTML5 geo location and some WebSocket magic

## Some ideas

* allow users to add friends
* ability to see active friends and their locations
* store ghosts
* start activity against a ghost; show gaps (distance / time) in real time
* audio cues
* store routes
* add preset route markers for audio cues / target splits
